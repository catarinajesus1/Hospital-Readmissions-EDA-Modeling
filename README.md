# Enhancing Patient Outcomes: A Propensity Model for Diabetic Patient Readmissions

The mission is to develop a readmissions model for diabetic patients, addressing critical concerns related to patient well-being, healthcare strain, and financial implications. The hospital seeks to identify cohorts within patient groups that may elevate the probability of readmission and create a machine-learning model to pinpoint patients most likely to return after treatment.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

In-depth analysis of historical data from 7500 diabetic patients.

Utilization of supplemental data to enrich insights.

Exploration of patient profiles, identifying patterns and cohorts.


**Propensity Model Development:**

Construction of a robust machine learning model to predict readmissions.

Incorporation of variables related to ailment, medicine intake, and physician information.

Rigorous evaluation of model performance to ensure accuracy and reliability.


**Top 100 Patient Identification:**

Application of the model to the test set of 2500 patients.

Identification of the top 100 patients most likely to be readmitted.

Unique identifier tagging for seamless integration into the pilot program.


**Variable Importance and Profile Analysis:**

Evaluation of variable importance to highlight key factors influencing readmissions.

Detailed exploration of the diabetic patient profile within historical records and the identified high-risk group.

Sound EDA to facilitate a comprehensive understanding for hospital executives.
